class KDegreeAnonymizer(AbstractAnonymizer):
    """
    Applies k-degree anonymity on a given graph G, modifying it to ensure that each node shares its degree with at
    least k-1 other nodes.

    The function implements the method described in Liu & Terzi's paper on k-degree anonymity (see reference [1]).

    Args:
        k (int): The k-anonymity degree parameter, ensuring each node's degree is shared by at least k-1 other nodes.
        noise (int, optional): The level of noise to add after failed anonymization attempts.
        with_deletions (bool, optional): If True, allows the deletion of edges to achieve k-degree anonymity.
